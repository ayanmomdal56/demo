So ,basically this is game where in HIT box (there comes a random  number of single digit) and there is timer of 60 sec and score(one win equals to 10 points).
if u choose the currect bubble in the box and its matches as the hit box then your score will increase to 10 points (within 60 sec that is 1 min)
